# Battleship

## Instructions to compile
*Make sure you've installed CMake.*

1. Open a terminal window in this directory.
2. Run `cmake -B ./build` in order to configure the project for the build.
3. Run `cmake --build ./build` in order to compile the project.

## Executables
We ship with 3 executables, saved in `./build`.
1. `battaglia_navale`, the actual game, the log file log.txt is saved in the current directory;
2. `replay`, you can review games that you played;
3. `charizard`, an interactive executable, tribute to the group name.

## Logs
We saved the log files in the `./logs` folder.
